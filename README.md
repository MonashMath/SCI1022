# SCI1022 - Introduction to scientific coding

This unit will teach the fundamental principles of writing and developing scientific computing code through the completion of practical modules. You will initially complete a compulsory introductory module that will cover the Unix command-line and the Git version-control system. You will then complete *two* of four elective modules covering the languages: R, Python, MATLAB and Mathematica. All the modules will be workshop-based and be taught using practical examples from various scientific disciplines. All modules will cover fundamental control structures, common file systems, input and output of data, two- and three-dimensional data plotting and the interpretation of these plots.

This repository includes the material for the first two weeks (Unix command-line and Git version-control system). The workshop material can be found in the corresponding Monash Moodle web page.

## Material

Material for the initial mandatory workshops (8 hours of computer lab in total).

## Lectures Schedule (initial mandatory workshops)

The week of 09/03/2020-13/03/2020 will be online. We ask the students to follow by their own the [Unix shell](./Unix-CLI.md) (5h).

The second week, we will solve questions about the Unix shell. Next, we will start working with Git. 

 * 16/03/2020 (2h) -  [Introduction to programming languages](./programming_languages.md) (~20 min). Start with [Git](./Git.md) (~1h 40min)
* 17/03/2020 (2h) - Finish [Git](./Git.md) (2h)
