# SCI1022 - Introduction to scientific coding

This unit will teach the fundamental principles of writing and developing scientific computing code through the completion of practical modules. You will initially complete a compulsory introductory module that will cover the Unix command-line and the Git version-control system. You will then complete *two* of four elective modules covering the languages: R, Python, MATLAB and Mathematica. All the modules will be workshop-based and be taught using practical examples from various scientific disciplines. All modules will cover fundamental control structures, common file systems, input and output of data, two- and three-dimensional data plotting and the interpretation of these plots.

This repository includes the material for the first two weeks (Unix command-line and Git version-control system). The workshop material can be found in the corresponding Monash Moodle web page.
