# SCI1022 - Introduction to scientific coding

This unit will teach the fundamental principles of writing and developing scientific computing code through the completion of practical modules. After an introduction to Scientific Programming and Computational Science, you will complete *two* of four elective modules covering the languages: R, Python, MATLAB and Mathematica. All the modules will be workshop-based and be taught using practical examples from various scientific disciplines. All modules will cover fundamental control structures, common file systems, input and output of data, two- and three-dimensional data plotting and the interpretation of these plots. Finally, in the last week, you will complete an introductory module that will cover the Unix command-line.

This repository includes the material for the Unix command-line. The workshop material can be found in the corresponding Monash Moodle web page.

## Material

Material for the initial mandatory workshops (8 hours of computer lab in total).

1. A, Introduction to programming languages and the elective modules: [`R`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)), [`Python`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), [`MATLAB`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB) and [`Mathematica`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Mathematica).<br>[[HTML]](./introduction.md)

## Optional material

Even though we consider very useful for a science student to know about Git version-control system and be familiar with `GitHub`, we do not have the time in the unit to explain these concepts. For interested students, we have created this introduction to Git _that is not part of the course but optional reading._
