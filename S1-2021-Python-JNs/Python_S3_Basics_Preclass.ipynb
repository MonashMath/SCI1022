    "\n",
    "In this first workshop we will introduce the **basics** of computer programming using Python. These will be exemplified with computer programs that evaluate mathematical formulas. While a computer program can solve certainly more challenging tasks than a calculator, mathematical formulas are easy to grasp (everyone has had to some extent exposure to them from early education stages) and let one introduce the basic fundamental concepts of computer programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, in the course of this workshop, you will learn, among others: \n",
    "  * What is a program and what do we mean by programming, \n",
    "  * How to write and run a Python program, \n",
    "  * How to evaluate complex arithmetic expressions,\n",
    "  * How to work with variables, \n",
    "  * How to print formatted text and numbers on screen,\n",
    "  * How to compute standard mathematical functions in Python, such as $e^x$ or $\\rm{sin} \\ x$,\n",
    "  * How to read input data from the keyboard,\n",
    "  * How to find extra information (beyond what we provide to you in the unit notebooks) when you need it.\n",
    "  \n",
    "To this end, we will rely on documents like the present one, a [**Jupyter notebook**](https://jupyter.org/). Jupyter notebooks will allow us to create and share documents that contain live code (program text), equations, visualizations and narrative text."

    "# Our first program: the formula for the vertical motion of a ball\n",
    "\n",
    "The first Python program that we are going to write in this course will just evaluate a mathematical formula. This formula describes the vertical motion of a ball thrown up from the ground level. The formula provides the vertical position of the ball, referred to as $y$, as a function of the time $t$ elapsed since the ball was thrown. From Newton's laws of motion, the formula is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(t)=v_0t-\\frac{1}{2}gt^2,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v_0$ denotes the initial velocity at which the ball is thrown, measured in $\\frac{m}{s}$ (meters per second), $g$ is (the magnitude of) the acceleration of the ball caused by the force of gravity, measured in $\\frac{m}{s^2}$ (meters per second squared), and $t$ denotes elapsed time measured in seconds. We assume that the ball is at the ground level at $t=0$, $y(0)=0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the time it takes the ball to move upwards and return to the ground again (i.e., $y=0$), we can look for solutions of the quadratic equation $y(t)=0$, namely $t=0$ and $t=2\\frac{v_0}{g}$. In other words, the ball returns to the ground level after $2\\frac{v_0}{g}$ seconds. Thus, it actually only makes sense to observe the position of the ball in the time interval $[0,2\\frac{v_0}{g}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using a Python program as a calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first Python program will evaluate the formula above for specific values of $v_0$, $g$, and $t$. In other words, we will use Python as a calculator. However, we note that Python is waaaay more expressive  and can certainly solve significantly more challenging problems than a mere calculator. For example, choosing $v_0=10 \\frac{m}{s}$, and $g=9.81 \\frac{m}{s^2}$, we have that the ball will come back to the ground level after approximately $2\\frac{v_0}{g} \\approx 2$ seconds. This basically implies that our interest is in the $[0,2]$ time interval. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that we want to compute the position of the ball after $t=1.2$ seconds. If we replace the value of $t$ in the formula above, we get the arithmetic expression\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(1.2)=10 \\cdot 1.2-\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9.81 \\cdot 1.2^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This arithmetic expression can be first **evaluated**, and then **printed on screen**, using the following single-line Python program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "print(10*1.2-0.5*9.81*1.2**2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python (as in most programming languages), the standard summation, subtraction, multiplication and division operators are written as `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`, respectively. In order to raise a number (`1.2` in our example) to the power of another number (`2` in our example), we have to use the exponentiation operator, denoted with two asterisks `**` in Python. We will later discuss different ways of running our single-line program, but let us first define what is a **program**, and what do we mean by **programming**."

    "## What is a program?\n",
    "\n",
    "A program is a sequence of instructions in a programming language that specifies how to perform a computation. The computation might be the solution to a mathematical problem, such as solving a linear system of equations via Gaussian elimination, or a symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document, processing an image or a video, etc. The program text, which contains the sequence of instructions, is stored in one or more text files. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the instructions in a programming language may look somewhat similar to English, they are way more simpler. The number of reserved words (e.g., `print` in our example above) and associated instructions is very limited, so that in order to perform a complicated computation, we have to use a large number of these instructions. The details look different in different languages, but **a few instructions types** appear in just about every programming language:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input**: Get data from the keyboard, a file, the network, or some other device.\n",
    "2. **Output**: Display data on the screen, save it in a file, or send it over the network.\n",
    "3. **Math**: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.\n",
    "4. **Conditional execution** (e.g., `if` statement): Check for certain conditions and change the behavior of the program depending on the condition.\n",
    "5. **Repetition**: (e.g., `while` and `for` loops): Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation among repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the course, we will go over these types of instructions step by step. You might be able to recognize some of these types of instructions in our single-line program above. **Every program you will ever develop/use, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look pretty much like these.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do we mean by programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is, naturally, the process of writing programs. This process is, however, much more challenging than merely writing the correct instructions in a file. Programming is a **problem-solving** skill in itself. It involves the ability to formulate problems, think about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. In a nutshell, it involves four basic steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To understand how a problem can be formulated computationally. We give a sequence of instructions to the computer in order to solve it. This is clearly the most difficult step.  You can think of this step as the process of breaking a large, complex task, into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be expressed in terms of the five type of instructions mentioned above.\n",
    "2. To express this sequence of instructions correctly in a computer language and store the corresponding text in a file (the program). This is normally the easiest part. \n",
    "3. To check the validity of the results obtained by the program. We must test the program. \n",
    "4. To systematically track down errors and fix them (this is referred to as **debugging**). Usually, the results are not as expected, and this is why we need this fourth phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Mastering these four steps requires a significant amount of training, which means writing many programs and getting the programs to produce the expected results.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing Python programs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several alternative types of tools that can be used for writing Python programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A Jupyter notebook (this document).\n",
    "2. A plain text editor.\n",
    "3. An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with a text editor.\n",
    "4. Cloud services accessed via a web browser, such as, e.g., [Python anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) or [Cocalc](https://cocalc.com/), or [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "What you will write will be the same in either of these types of tools, the difference lies in how you run the program. In this course, we will mainly use Jupyter notebooks on your local computer, like this document, to write, run, and deliver Python programs. It is out of the scope of the course to discuss all possible tools for writing Python programs. For the interested reader, recommended tools of type 2 include Notepad++ for Windows, Atom and TextWrangler for MacOS X, and Gedit, Atom, and Sublime Text (for Linux).  The dominating tool of type 3 for Python programs is called [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), and it is available on either Windows, Mac, or Linux. Some of the more advanced plain text editors (e.g., Atom, or Sublime Text) can be converted into IDEs using the appropriate configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Python programs\n",
    "\n",
    "In Jupyter notebooks, we write program text into code cells, and then left-click the \"Run\" button at the tool bar located at the top of the page to run the code within the cell. Right below this text you can see a code cell which contains our one-line program above. Code cells, in contrast to text cells, are labeled with `In [ ]:` right at the left of the first line of code within the cell. **Run it!** (Note that you first have to left-click either on the interior or the left-hand-side margin of the cell, to put focus on it, before clicking on the \"Run\" button).

    "\n",
    "Programming languages tend to have **very strict syntax rules** that govern the structure of the statements. Syntax rules come in two flavors: tokens and structure. Tokens are the words, numbers and symbols that make up the statement in the programming language. For example, the expression `2+3` has three tokens. On the other hand, structure refers to the way the tokens can be combined.  For example, `3 * / 4` is illegal, because even if all tokens are legal, you cannot have `/` right after `*`.\n",

    "## Warning about typing program text. Errors and debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Our communication with the computer using a programming language must be precise, without a single error (e.g., in spelling or punctuation). The programmer must type the program very carefully, paying attention to the correctness of every character. For example, you will see along the course that blank spaces are crucial in Python (e.g., in order to indent a new code block inside an existing code block). It is a good practice to always count them and type them in correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any error, no matter how small, can affect to the result of the program. There are, essentially, three kind of errors in a program:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Syntax errors**. This kind of errors are produced whenever one violates the rules underlying the structure of a program. For example, parenthesis come in pairs. If you open a parenthesis, and you forget to close it, then you have made a syntax error.  Another example has been already shown above, i.e., to use `write` instead of `print`. **If there is a syntax error in your program, Python will generate an error message, and your program will stop, you will not able to run it.** During your first weeks with programming you will likely make a lot of syntax errors and spend some time tracking down them. However, you will experience that the more you practice, the less syntax errors you will made, and the faster you will find them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Run-time errors**. This kind of errors are produced after the program has started running. These errors are also called exceptions, because they usually indicate that something exceptional has happened. Dividing a number by zero is an example of a run-time error. These errors are much less likely than syntax errors, especially while one is walking the first steps with programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Semantic errors**. If your program has a semantic error, then it will completely run without any error message, but it won't generate the expected result. The program is doing something different to what it was intended. The issue in this case is that what we told it to do is not what we actually want it to do. Semantic errors are the hardest errors to find and resolve, as they require one to work backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "An error in a program is known as a **bug**, and the process of locating and removing bugs is called **debugging**. Many look at debugging as the most difficult and challenging part of computer programming. Learning to debug can be frustrating, but it is a valuable skill that is useful for many activities beyond programming. The origin of the strange terms bug and debugging can be found in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Etymology)."

As you walk your first steps in programming, you will experience that the output of your program is frequently wrong, and you have to search for errors. For our single-line program, we can use a calculator to evaluate the mathematical formula for $v_0=10$ and $t=1.2$, and verify that the result obtained with the calculator matches the one produced with the program.\n",

By solely reading the name of the variable it should be easy to grasp the meaning of the variable, like `initial_velocity` or `position`. \n",

    "Variable names can be as long as you like. They can contain both letters and numbers, but they cannot begin with a number. Python distinguishes between upper and lower case, so the variable name `G` is always different from `g`. **In any case, it is conventional to use only lower case for variable names.** The underscore character `_` can appear in a variable name. It is frequently used in names with multiple words, such as `initial_velocity`, or `beam_length`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our advice for choosing variable names involves two basic, easy-to-remember rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Whenever the variable represents a mathematical symbol, we use the symbol as variable name. In our example program, $y$, $g$, and $v_0$ in our mathematical formula become `y`, `g`, and `v0` in the program. **Variable names similar to their mathematical symbols increases the readability of the program and eases error detection.** \n",
    "2. If the variable does not have a match in the mathematical description of the problem, use a descriptive name. For example, if our variable represents traction force, we could call it `traction` or `traction_force`. \n",

Fortunately, you don't have to memorize all the keywords in the list.
