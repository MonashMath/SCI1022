    "\n",
    "We introduce **conditional execution statements**, also known as `if` statements, or simply conditionals. Conditional statements come in handy whenever the flow of execution of a computer program needs to branch, i.e., to perform a different action depending on the evaluation of a logical (boolean) condition. (Boolean expressions are those that have either the value `True` or `False`). It turns out that in many different scenarios we need this ability of being able to execute different code depending on the state of the program.\n",

    "# Branching (conditional) statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow of instructions of a program often needs to branch, i.e., to execute a different set of instructions depending on the evaluation of logical (also known as boolean) conditions.  In this section we overview how we can express branching in Python, and the different variants of branching statements available.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single `if` statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form of a conditional statement is the single `if` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    <block of statements>\n",
    "<next statement>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`if` statements have the same structure as function definitions: a header followed by an indented body (i.e., `<block of statements>`). If the `condition` after the `if` keyword is evaluated to `True`, then the indented `<block of statements>` is executed. If it is evaluated to `False`, then nothing happens, i.e., the `<block of statements>` is not executed. In either case, the program's flow moves to `<next statement>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of the single `if` statement is illustrated in the cells below."

    "x=3\n",
    "if x>0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "print(\"next statement\")"
   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "code",
   "execution_count": null,

    "x=-1\n",
    "if x>0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",

    "In both code cells, `<block of statements>` is composed of a single statement, although this block can contain as many statements as you like. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the first cell prints the message `\"x is positive\"` on screen, the second does not, as `x>0` evaluates to `False` when `x` is equal to `-1`. Both cells print the `\"next statement\"` message on screen, as the indentation of `print(\"next statement\")` matches the one of the `if`, and thus marks the end of its body. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative execution (`if-else` blocks)\n",
    "\n",
    "A second form of branching statements is the so-called `if-else` blocks. In this form, there are two possibilities, and the condition determines which one of these gets executed. The syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    <block of statements, executed if condition is True>\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    <block of statements, executed if condition is False>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When `condition` evaluates to `True`, the program flow branches into the first block of statements. If `condition` evaluates to `False`, the program flow jumps to the second block of statements, right after the `else:` line. The two blocks of statements are indented, as with the single `if` statement. Since the `condition` must be either `True` or `False`, **one and only one of the two alternatives gets executed.**\n",

    "\n",
