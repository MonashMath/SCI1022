# SCI1022 - Unix shell Jupyter Notebook - S2 2020

**Only as a temporary fallback solution**, I have created an executable environment on the cloud for week 12 of the course. The only thing that you need is to click on the `binder` badge  below to launch the Jupyter notebook on your browser. This way you do not need _anything_ locally on your computer. Be patient, the start up of the Jupyter notebook _can take a considerable amount of time_ the first time.

Please, take into account the following warnings when working with `binder`. 

1. Once you have finished your work, you have to click at the `Download` button in the center of the Jupyter control bar. 
2. However ...
**this service has a (very) short inactivity timeout for sessions.**
 Going for a short break is likely to have your session ended before you get back. In such a case you can still download your work so far, but you may not be able to continue working on the same notebook but start instead from scratch. In order to cope for this issue, you have to read (and understand) the instructions available [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/getting-your-notebook-after-your-binder-has-stopped/3268).
