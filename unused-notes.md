The difference between these two families of languages is when the _types are checked_ (ahead run-time or in run-time). E.g., the operation `a+b` where `a=1` and `b='Hello'` is illegal (what does it mean?). A static language will check whether the types of the variables (`a` and `b` in this example) lead to correct instructions before being run, at compilation time. A dynamic language will only check it in run-time, when the operation is interpreted. As we have learned static vs. interpreted is about the _translation_ process, whereas _static vs. dynamic_ is about the type checking.
