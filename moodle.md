# Section 1: Key information

SCI1022 will teach the fundamental principles of scientific programming coding through the completion of introductory sessions to scientific programming and computational science, two practical workshops and an introduction to the Unix shell. You will choose two out of four workshops covering the languages R, Python, MATLAB and Mathematica. All the workshops will be taught using practical examples from various scientific disciplines. All workshops will cover fundamental control structures, common file systems, input and output of data, two- and three-dimensional data plotting and the interpretation of these plots.

# Section 2: Assessment

This unit does involves a project-based continuous evaluation, no exams. More specifically, the final mark will be computed as follows:

* 10% pre-clas tests (quizzes): Based on some pre-class material given to students, and some short questions to be evaluated at the beginning of the class. 8 best out of 10 for this part. Individual evaluation. The first pre-class test will be about the lectures in week 1. The other ones will be related to each workshop session.

* 40% in-class assignment: Instructors will give a problem to students at the end of workshop sessions. Individual evaluation but in-class cooperation would be promoted. 8 best out of 10. Individual evaluation.

* 50% after-class assignment: Instructors will set up assignments during the workshops that students will do at home and submit before a given deadline. The assignment marks for each workshop will represent 20% of the final mark. The Unix shell introduction in Week 12 is common to all students, and will involve an assignment that will be 10% of the final mark. Individual evaluation.

# Section 3: Lectures / Workshops

The structure of the unit is the following:

*__Week 1 (session 1):__* The first 2h session in Week 1 includes an introduction to programming and programming languages (1h) and a short introduction to the four different programming languages being offered in this unit (Python, Matlab, Mathematica, R). After this session, you must fill a Moodle quizz in which you pick the two languages you want to learn. This quizz must be submitted before session 2 in week 1.

*__Week 1 (session 2):__* The second 2h session in Week 1 includes a 1h introduction to computational science. After that, we will have a 1h session in which students will receive technical support installing all the tools needed in their selected workshops.

*__Week 2-11:__* In weeks 2-11, you will learn how to code in two different programming languages that you *must* choose among Python, Matlab, Mathematica and R (more details in Week 1 assignment). The info about each workshop can be found in the respective Moodle pages (see below).

*__Week 12:__* In week 12, we will introduce you to the `bash` shell. This week is common to all students.

### Install Mathematica

Monash has a site license for Mathematica. Students should download and install it on their personal laptop (Mac, linux, or Windows).

It may be downloaded from the [Mathematica download page](https://www.monash.edu/esolutions/software/mathematica-install), using your Monash email address. __Do not use any other email address, or the license will not work__. This should be done __*before week 2*__ of the semester.

Select "Mathematica for Sites (Single Machine)" and the latest version on the Wolfram User Portal. The download and installation may take up to several tens of minutes, depending on your internet speed. It is a large package.
