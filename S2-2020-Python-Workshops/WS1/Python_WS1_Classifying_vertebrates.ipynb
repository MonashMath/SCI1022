    "#### Refactoring #1: Single invocation to print\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution probably has several statements which start with `print(\"It is a ...`. What if your boss asked you to make your code reply with `Your species is in the bird class.` instead? This is a wordier way of giving the answer, but there's no accounting for taste. \n",

    "> print(\"Your species is in the \" + cls + \" class.\")\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Then, change the rest of the code so that it functions the same as your solution above but only calls `print` once. Note that, in the previous code, you cannot use the word `class` for the variable name, as `class` is a Python **keyword**. A keyword is a reserved word that has a special meaning to Python and thus cannot be used as a variable name. Other examples of keywords are: `if`, `def`, and `while`."

    "1. Use a `while True:` loop, and the fact that the `return` statement exits a function immediately, whether in a loop or not. \n",
    "2. While programming the previous loop, chances are high the you end up with an infinite loop. In order to interrupt the Python kernel underlying the Jupyter notebook, left-click on the cell, and hit the keyboard key labeled as `i` twice. \n",
    "3. To convert a string-typed variable named, say `response`, to lowercase, you can call its `lower` method as `response.lower()`. A method is similar to a function, but it uses a slightly different syntax: the period (also known as simply dot) in between the variable (object) and the method. Calling a method is like making a request: we are asking `response` to become lowercased. If you do not entirely grasp the concept of a method at this point, don't worry, we will work out the concept of classes, objects and methods later on in the Python workshop.\n",
