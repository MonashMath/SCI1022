# SCI1022 - Python Workshops Jupyter Notebooks - S2 2020

The Python module of SCI1022 in S2 2020 is led by [@amartinhuertas](https://github.com/amartinhuertas). For more details, go to the Moodle page of the module, available [here](https://lms.monash.edu/course/view.php?id=81833).

As mentioned there, it is **indispensable** that you are able to set up a Python-based development environment in your Desktop or Laptop. To this end, you have to follow the instructions available at the Moodle page. If you have any issue during the process, you can write your question into the technical installation issues forum.

**Only as a temporary fallback solution**, I have created an executable environment on the cloud for week 2 of the course. The only thing that you need is to click on the `binder` badges  below to launch the Jupyter notebooks on your browser. This way you do not need _anything_ locally on your computer. Be patient, the start up of the Jupyter notebook _can take a considerable amount of time_ the first time.

As mentioned above, this is only a temporary fallback solution for the second week of the unit. **If you are still having issues/struggling with your local installation**, please let us know 
ASAP through the appropriate Moodle forum, and we will look for a solution. 

Please, take into account the following warnings when working with `binder`. 

1. Once you have finished your work, you have to click at the `Download` button in the center of the Jupyter control bar. 
2. However ...
**this service has a (very) short inactivity timeout for sessions.**
 Going for a short break is likely to have your session ended before you get back. In such a case you can still download your work so far, but you may not be able to continue working on the same notebook but start instead from scratch. In order to cope for this issue, you have to read (and understand) the instructions available [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/getting-your-notebook-after-your-binder-has-stopped/3268).
