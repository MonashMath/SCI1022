    "1. **An array can keep only elements of the same type**, preferably `int`, `float`, or `complex` numbers,\n",

This means arrays are more efficient for efficient numerical computing and storage (because, among others, we donâ€™t need to store the type for every element). It also makes arrays the data structure of choice for numerical calculations where we often deal with vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The number  of elements in an array must be known when the array is created.** Once created, the number of elements in an array *can* be changed, but at a substantial significant computational cost.\n",

In addition to these operations, it turns out that in numerical computing it is of paramount importance to be able to support efficiently the application of a function (e.g., a mathematical expression) to all elements in a vector at once.\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "In the rest of the tutorial, we are going to write a code that simulates the motion of a projectile thrown up at a given initial velocity from the ground level. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will restrict ourselves to 1D motion, i.e., the projectile only moves north (up) or south (down) in the vertical direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested into determine both the **displacement** of the projectile *with respect to the ground* (i.e., its height), and the **velocity** of the projectile, at each point in time. Recall that both **displacement** and **velocity** are vectors, and thus have a magnitude and a direction. In 1D, the sign indicates the direction of vector quantities. For the displacement we will adopt the convention that a positive sign means that the projectile is above the ground level, and positive and negative velocity, that it is moving north and south, respectively. Thus, for example, zero displacement means that the object is on the ground level, and a velocity of -5 $\\frac{m}{s}$ that the projectile is moving down, where $m$ denotes \"meters\", and $s$ \"seconds\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned at the beginning of the tutorial, we are going to work under the assumption that the projectile is going to be sufficiently close to the surface of Earth such that the gravitational force among the object and the Earth pulls down the objects with a uniform (i.e., constant) acceleration. Accordingly to Newton's universal law of gravitation, such constant acceleration is of 9.8 $\\frac{m}{s^2}$ of magnitude. Recall that the acceleration is also a vector. The direction of the gravitational acceleration is always south (under the assumption above), and thus the acceleration caused by the gravitational force has a negative sign. In other words, the acceleration vector always points downwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have guessed (from experience among others), the motion subject of study can be split into two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The projectile first moves north**. During this stage, the initial velocity at which the projectile is thrown, progressively decreases due to the acceleration (actually deceleration) of gravity, until at a point in time that the velocity reaches $0$ $\\frac{m}{s}$, i.e., the projectile is instantaneously not moving. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The projectile then moves south**. During this stage, the velocity progressively increases (pointing towards the ground) due to the acceleration of gravity, until at a point in time that the projectile hits the ground. \n",
    "\n",
    "We denote as $\\vec{x}(t)$ and $\\vec{v}(t)$ the displacement and velocity of the projectile, respectively, $t$ seconds after throwing it upward. $T$ denotes the simulation time, i.e., we assume that we are going to simulate the process in the time interval $t \\in [0,T]$. $\\vec{v}_0=\\vec{v}(0)$ is the initial velocity at which the projectile is thrown. If we apply basic kinematics, we have that the displacement and velocity are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\vec{x}(t) = \\vec{v}_0 \\cdot t - 9.8 \\cdot \\frac{t^2}{2}$\n",
    "2. $\\vec{v}(t) = \\vec{v}_0 - 9.8 \\cdot t$\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we are lucky to have Newton providing us with analytical expressions for the displacement and velocity **exactly** as a function of time. However, this is unfortunately not the case in the vast majority of real-world simulations, and we have instead to work with numerical approximations to simulate the problem at hand. This is the main point of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build an approximation of $\\vec{x}(t)$ and $\\vec{v}(t)$ we are going to split the time interval $[0,T]$ into equally-sized time subintervals of size denoted as $\\Delta t$, and **assume that the velocity is constant within each of these subintervals**. We will refer to  $\\Delta t$ as the \"time-step\" size. Why is this just an approximation? As you can see in the equation above for $\\vec{v}(t)$, **the velocity continuously changes with $t$**, but we are assuming it to be constant subinterval-wise. However, we will check using code that if $\\Delta t$ is small enough, these approximations are good enough.\n",

    "><span style=\"color:red\">**Task 7.**</span> Write two functions `compute_exact_displacements` and `compute_exact_velocities` that given an array which stores several points in time, returns an output array of the same size of the input array with the exact displacements and velocities at such points in time. Several hints and remarks:\n",
    "* Use the analytical expressions provided above for $\\vec{x}(t)$ and $\\vec{v}(t)$.\n",
    "* Think about the interface of the functions. Apart from the input array with the times, which parameters do the functions need?\n",
    "* Recall from above that you can perform calculations on every element in the vector with a single statement (i.e., you can exploit vectorization with Numpy). For example, you can add or multiply an scalar by an array, or take of the power of an array.\n",
    "* Use the two code cells provided below to test your functions. Note that in these cells we are generating a large number of different times (i.e., a small space among times passed to the `arange` function) in order to have an accurate plot of the exact displacement and velocities. Also note that we are assuming that `v_approx[0]` stores the initial velocity."
